-- 1. Analyze the number of responses for each quiz question
SELECT question, 
       COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS response_count
FROM survey
GROUP BY question 
ORDER BY question;

-- Insight: This query helps identify at which questions users tend to drop off, allowing for targeted improvements in the quiz design.

-- 2. Preview the first five rows of each table to understand their structure
SELECT * FROM quiz LIMIT 5; 
SELECT * FROM home_try_on LIMIT 5; 
SELECT * FROM purchase LIMIT 5; 

-- Insight: Reviewing sample data from each table provides clarity on available fields and their potential relationships, aiding in accurate query construction.

-- 3. Create a consolidated user journey table
SELECT DISTINCT q.user_id, 
       h.user_id IS NOT NULL AS is_home_try_on,
       h.number_of_pairs, 
       p.user_id IS NOT NULL AS is_purchase
FROM quiz AS q
LEFT JOIN home_try_on AS h ON h.user_id = q.user_id
LEFT JOIN purchase AS p ON p.user_id = q.user_id
LIMIT 10;

-- Insight: This combined view enables tracking of each user's progression through the funnel stages, facilitating detailed analysis of conversion rates.

-- 4. Calculate conversion rates between funnel stages
WITH funnels AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT q.user_id, 
           h.user_id IS NOT NULL AS is_home_try_on,
           h.number_of_pairs, 
           p.user_id IS NOT NULL AS is_purchase
    FROM quiz AS q
    LEFT JOIN home_try_on AS h ON h.user_id = q.user_id
    LEFT JOIN purchase AS p ON p.user_id = q.user_id
)
SELECT number_of_pairs, 
       COUNT(user_id) AS num_browse, 
       SUM(is_home_try_on) AS num_home_try_on, 
       SUM(is_purchase) AS num_purchase, 
       ROUND(1.0 * SUM(is_home_try_on) / COUNT(user_id), 2) AS percentage_try_on,
       ROUND(1.0 * SUM(is_purchase) / SUM(is_home_try_on), 2) AS percentage_purchase
FROM funnels
WHERE number_of_pairs IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY number_of_pairs;

-- Insight: This analysis reveals the effectiveness of offering different numbers of try-on pairs, informing decisions on optimizing the Home Try-On program to boost conversions.
